# voucher-decentralized
This project aims to create a abstract voucher system to create decenteralized assets from centeralized digital assets.
This centeralized assets can be anything items or pets in games to music. 
And the accepted owner  of these assets (developer of the game, composer of the music etc.) can create a signed voucher that will be verified on blockchain which will eventually create an asset.
